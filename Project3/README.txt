How to Run the Soccer Avoidance Algorithms: 
    Dynamic Programming Solution:
        1. Download "soccerDPTime.py"
        2. This solution uses the time and random module. Please make sure this is downloaded to ensure 
           that the program runs properly.
        3. Type "python3 soccerDPTime.py" 
        4. You are done!
